1. Create a python method that takes arguments int X and int Y,
and updates DEPART and RETURN fields
in test_payload1.xml:

- DEPART gets set to X days in the future from the current date
(whatever the current date is at the moment of executing the code)
- RETURN gets set to Y days in the future from the current date

Please write the modified XML to a new file.

2. Create a python method that takes a json element
as an argument, and removes that element from test_payload.json.

Please verify that the method can remove either nested or non-nested elements
(try removing "outParams" and "appdate").

Please write the modified json to a new file.

3. Create a python script that parses jmeter log files in CSV format,
and in the case if there are any non-successful endpoint responses recorded in the log,
prints out the label, response code, response message, failure message,
and the time of non-200 response in human-readable format in PST timezone
(e.g. 2021-02-09 06:02:55 PST).

Please use Jmeter_log1.jtl, Jmeter_log2.jtl as input files for testing out your script
(the files have .jtl extension but the format is  CSV).
